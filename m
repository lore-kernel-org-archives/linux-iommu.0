About a month ago on #linux-rockchip we were discussing PM 'stuff':
https://libera.catirclogs.org/linux-rockchip/2026-05-15#39939137;
which references this paste
https://paste.sr.ht/~diederik/89d9f84e22474e837b55286d213b67f03859ce2e
I've since removed the DCDC_REG2 for PineTab2 and the 'fix' should likely
be extended to cover all RK3566/RK3568 devices though.

It's what I made at the time hoping to fix a suspend/resume issue when
trying upstream TF-A. It didn't fix the issue at the time, but may still
be useful/needed and I think it's what Chaoyi hinted at.

Just yesterday, Jonas posted this patch which may be useful/needed too:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-rockchip/20260609154124.445182-1-jonas@kwiboo=
.se/

HTH,

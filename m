I agree with that, it is not explicitly forbidden to have an
sg->offset > PAGE_SIZE and most IOMMU drivers handle this case.

So this is a problem I'd like to see resolved in the VT-d driver too. If
nobody comes up with a correct fix soon I'll apply this one and rip out
the large-page support from __domain_mapping() to make it work.

Speaking of __domain_mapping(), this function is a big unmaintainable
mess which should be split and rewritten. A clean and maintainable
rewrite can alse re-add the large-page support.

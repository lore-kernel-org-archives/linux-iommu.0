Indeed this could be an option for setup.

However a substitute to msi_domain_set_affinity should also be found I
think, to handle a change in affinity (which can change the doorbell):

We have this path and irq_migrate_all_off_this_cpu takes the irq_desc
raw_spin_lock.

cpuhotplug.c:irq_migrate_all_off_this_cpu
cpuhotplug.c:migrate_one_irq
irq_do_set_affinity
chip->irq_set_affinity
msi_domain_set_affinity
../..
iommu_map/unmap

Yes currently I assume a single page per MSI controller which is
arbitrary. I can add such callback in my next version.

Thank you for your time

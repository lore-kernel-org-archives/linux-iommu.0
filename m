AMD processors still don't support CPUID Faulting (or at least, I
couldn't find any reference to it in the latest docs), so we cannot
actually hide SME from a guest which goes looking at native CPUID. 
Furthermore, I'm not aware of any CPUID masking support covering that leaf.

However, if Linux is using the paravirtual cpuid hook, things are
slightly better.

On Xen 4.9 and later, no guests will see the feature.  On earlier
versions of Xen (before I fixed the logic), plain domUs will not see the
feature, while dom0 will.

For safely, I'd recommend unilaterally clobbering the feature as Boris
suggested.  There is no way SME will be supportable on a per-PV guest
basis, although (as far as I am aware) Xen as a whole would be able to
encompass itself and all of its PV guests inside one single SME instance.

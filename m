Hi all,

Thanks for your comments.

I can explain the use case and maybe we can figure out if this approach=
=20
is the correct one to solve it.

The problem is that I have devices behind an IOMMU which I would like t=
o=20
use with DMA. Vinod recently moved forward with his and Linus Walleij
patch '[PATCH] dmaengine: use phys_addr_t for slave configuration' whic=
h=20
clarifies that the DMA slave address provided by a client is the=20
physical address. This puts the task of mapping the DMA slave address=20
from a phys_addr_t to a dma_addr_t on the DMA engine.

Without an IOMMU this is easy since the phys_addr_t and dma_addr_t are=20
the same and no special care is needed. However if you have a IOMMU you=
=20
need to map the DMA slave phys_addr_t to a dma_addr_t using something=20
like this. Is it not very similar to dma_map_single() where one maps=20
processor virtual memory (instead if MMIO) so that it can be used with=20
DMA slaves?

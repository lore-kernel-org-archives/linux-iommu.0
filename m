I don't really like "ioctl" and "naive implementation" in the same
thought.  The ioctl itself needs to be well thought out for current and
future needs, including independence from the source data type
(OF/DT/ACPI/etc), proven that it's necessary, it's not redundant to
existing interfaces, and vfio should be the one hosting it.  Thanks,

Alex

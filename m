To nitpick, "the first of one or more contiguous pages" does not imply
"the first page of the buffer" - the buffer just lies *somewhere* within
that run of pages.

Historically, it looks like page+offset first came about in the 2.5 era
to support highmem[1] - note that scatterlist users still only really
care about virtual and DMA address, not physical. Sure, it wouldn't be
entirely impossible to use phys_addr_t instead, but at this point it
would be a massively invasive change, and would make implementations of
one DMA API callback a tiny bit simpler at the cost of pushing rather
more complexity out to hundreds of other users, some of whom might not
even call dma_map_sg().

The fact is, regardless of how much sense it does or doesn't make, a
fair amount of scatterlist-mangling code exists that is capable of
generating silly offsets, and it's so simple to make sure the DMA API
implementations don't care that I'd rather just keep on top of that than
go off on a crusade in attempt to wipe out the grey areas.

	unsigned int	offset;

I'm gonna say no ;)

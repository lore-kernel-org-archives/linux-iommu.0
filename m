This is v4 of pKVM SMMUv3 support, this version is quite different from
the previous ones as it implements nested SMMUv3 using trap and emulate:
v1: Implements full fledged pv interface
https://lore.kernel.org/kvmarm/20230201125328.2186498-1-jean-philippe@linar=
o.org/

v2:  Implements full fledged pv interface (+ more features as evtq and s1)
https://lore.kernel.org/kvmarm/20241212180423.1578358-1-smostafa@google.com=
/

v3: Only DMA isolation (using pv)
https://lore.kernel.org/kvmarm/20250728175316.3706196-1-smostafa@google.com=
/

Based on the feedback on v3, having a separate driver was too complicated
to maintain. So, the alternatives were either to integrate the KVM
implementation in the current driver and rely on impl ops, I have PoC for i=
t:
https://android-kvm.googlesource.com/linux/+log/refs/heads/pkvm-smmu-implop=
s-poc

Or just go for the final goal which is nested translation using trap and
emulate which is implemented in this series.

Other major changes, is that io-pgtable-arm is not split to a common file,
however kernel specific code was factored out (mostly memory allocation
and selftests) based on Robin feedback.

Design:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Assumptions:
------------

As mentioned, this is a completely different approach which uses trapping
of the SMMUv3 MMIO space and emulating some of these accesses.

One of the important points, is that this doesn=E2=80=99t emulate the full =
SMMUv3
architecture, but only the parts used by Linux kernel, that=E2=80=99s why e=
nablement
of this (ARM_SMMU_V3_PKVM) depends on (ARM_SMMU_V3=3Dy) so we are sure of t=
he
driver behaviour.

Any new change in the driver will likely trigger a WARN_ON ending up in pan=
ic.

Most notable assumptions:
- Changing of stream table format/size or l2 pointers is not allowed after
initialization.
- leaf=3D0 CFGI is not allowed
- CFGI_ALL with any value but 31 is not allowed
- Some commands which are not used are not allowed (ex CMD_TLBI_NH_ALL)
- Values set in ARM_SMMU_CR1 are hardcoded and don't change.


Emulation logic mainly targets:

1) Command Queue
----------------
At boot time, the hypervisor will allocate a shadow command queue (doesn=E2=
=80=99t need
to match the host size) which then sets up in HW, then it will trap access =
to

i) ARM_SMMU_CMDQ_BASE
That can only be written when the cmdq is disabled. Then on enable, the hyp=
ervisor
will put the host command queue in a shared state to avoid transition into =
the
hypervisor or VMs. It will be unshared with the cmdq is disabled

ii) ARM_SMMU_CMDQ_PROD
Trigger emulation code, where the hypervisor will copy the commands between=
 cons and
prod, of the host queue and sanitise them (mostly WARNs if the host is mali=
cious and
issuing commands it shouldn=E2=80=99t) then eagerly consume them, updating =
the host cons.

iii) ARM_SMMU_CMDQ_CONS
No much logic, just return the emulated cons + error bits.

2) Stream table
---------------
Similar to the command queue, the first level is allocated at boot with max=
 possible
size, then the hypervisor  will trap access to:
i) ARM_SMMU_STRTAB_BASE/ARM_SMMU_STRTAB_BASE_CFG: Keep track of the stream =
table to
put it in a shared state.

On CFGI_STE, the hypervisor will read the STE in scope from the host copy, =
shadow
L2 pointers if needed and attach stage-2.

3) GBPA
-------
The hypervisor will set GBPA to abort at boot, then any access to GBPA from=
 the host
will return the value set by the host. The host only sets ABORT so that is =
fine.
Otherwise we can always return ABORT is set even if not which makes it look=
 like HW
is not responding to updates.


Bisectibility:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
I wrote the patches where most of them are bisectable at run time (so we ca=
n run
with a prefix of the series till MMIO emulation, cmdq emulation, STE or ful=
l nested)
that was very helpful in debugging, and I kept like this to make debugging =
easier.

Constraints:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
1) Discovery:
-------------
Only device tree is supported at the moment.
I don=E2=80=99t usually use ACPI, but I can look into adding that later. (n=
ot make this
series bigger)

2) Errata:
----------
Some HW with both stage-1 and stage-2 but can=E2=80=99t run nested translat=
ion due to some errata,
which makes the driver remove nesting for MMU_700, I believe this is too re=
strictive.
At the moment KVM will use nesting if advertised. (Or we need other mechani=
sm to exclude
only the affected HW)

3) Shadow page table
--------------------
Uses page granularity (leaf) for memory, that=E2=80=99s because of the lack=
 of split_block_unmap()
logic. I am currently looking into the possibility of sharing page tables,
if that turned complicated (as expected) it might be worth to re-add this l=
ogic

Boot flow:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The hypervisor initialises at =E2=80=9Cmodule_init=E2=80=9D.
Before that, at =E2=80=9Ccore_initcall=E2=80=9D the SMMUv3 KVM code will
- Register the hypervisor ops with the hypervisor
- Parse the device tree and populate an array with the SMMUs to the hypervi=
sor.

At =E2=80=9Cmodule_init=E2=80=9D, the hypervisor init will run, where the S=
MMU driver will:
- Take over the SMMus description
- Probe the SMMUs (from IDRs) I tried to make most of this code common usin=
g macros.
- Take over the SMMUs MMIO space so it will be trapped.
- Take over and set up the shadow command queue and stream table.

With =E2=80=9CARM_SMMU_V3_PKVM=E2=80=9D enabled, the current SMMU driver wi=
ll register at
=E2=80=9Cdevice_initcall_sync=E2=80=9D so it can run after the kernel de-pr=
ivileges and the
hypervisor is set up.

Future work
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
1) Sharing page tables will be an interesting optimization, but requires de=
aling with
stage-2 page faults (which are handled by the kernel), BBM and possibly mor=
e complexity.

2) There is currently ongoing work to enable RPM, that will possibly enable=
/disable
the SMMU frequently, we might need some optimizations to avoid re-shadowing=
 the
CMDQ/STE unnecessarily.

3) Look into ACPI support.

Patches overview

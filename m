A vfio-platform driver was bound to the passthrough'ed device. QEMU
current knows the compat string of the device and the node's name and
that's it.

The VFIO platform driver currently does not allow to return device
specific information. It just returns generic info such as resource
info. The driver is HW agnostic.


The QEMU VFIO device should be able to check some characteristics of the
host device tree. Typically if the host node does not comply with some
constraints it may not be possible to assign the device.

We do not want the QEMU end-user to have in-depth knowledge of the HW so
passing the info in the QEMU command line does not sound to be the good
solution.


As you mentioned /proc/device-tree depends on kernel option. I am able
to find the properties in sysfs too but can we systematically rely on
sysfs (CONFIG_SYSFS)? Also I would have expected the values to be human
readable but they are not. Currently investigating open/read from qemu
but is better than an ioctl API? ...

Please let me know if I answered to your question.

Best Regards

Eric

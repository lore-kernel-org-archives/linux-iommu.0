/sys/firmware/fdt is the original, unadulterated DTB passed to the
kernel, while /sys/firmware/device-tree is the unflattened form which
may have had overlays (or perhaps other fixups) applied.

For runtime stuff I'd generally expect /sys/firmware/device-tree to be
preferable (e.g. if we want to expose some device added by an overlay).
We added /sys/firmware/fdt for kexec, as memory reservations are in the
DTB header, which doesn't show up in the unflattened tree.

I don't think you can realistically expose host AML to the guest. Even
if it doesn't overwrite itself, it could perform oneshot configuration
that breaks if executed repeatedly, try to access otehr bits of ACPI
which may or may not be present, call to secure firmware, etc.

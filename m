dmabuf can do that ... it is call uptr you can look at i915 for
instance. Still this does not answer my question above, why do
you need to be in VFIO to do any of the above thing ? Kernel has
tons of examples that does all of the above and are not in VFIO
(including usinng existing user pointer with device).

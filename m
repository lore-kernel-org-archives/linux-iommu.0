meaning either you allow unsafe multiplexing with passthrough in every
flavor (unsafely) or you don't allow it at all?

I didn't know such on option existed, but it seems to me that this fits
the bill exactly.

It sounds good to me, that would allow us to release a GICv2m-based
solution for MSI passthrough on currently available hardware like the
Seattle.

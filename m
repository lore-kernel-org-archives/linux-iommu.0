Will do.

Btw, I tried to update all the subjects and descriptions to be
more descriptive but I'm sure there is still room for improvement
so keep the comments on them coming.

Correct. I like the hierarchy term so I'll add that to the text.

Note, just because the bit is set in %cr3 doesn't mean the full
hierarchy is encrypted. Each level in the hierarchy needs to have the
encryption bit set. So, theoretically, you could have the encryption
bit set in %cr3 so that the PGD is encrypted, but not set the encryption
bit in the PGD entry for a PUD and so the PUD pointed to by that entry
would not be encrypted.

Thanks,
Tom

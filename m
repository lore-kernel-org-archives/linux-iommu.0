Alex answered to this I think:
"
x86 isn't problem-free in this space.  An x86 VM is going to know that
the 0xfee00000 address range is special, it won't be backed by RAM and
won't be a DMA target, thus we'll never attempt to map it for an iova
address.  However, if we run a non-x86 VM or a userspace driver, it
doesn't necessarily know that there's anything special about that range
of iovas.  I intend to resolve this with an extension to the iommu info
ioctl that describes the available iova space for the iommu.  The
interrupt region would simply be excluded.
"

I am not sure I've addressed this requirement yet but it seems more
future proof to have an IOMMU mapping for those addresses.

For the ARM use case I think Marc gave guidance:
"
We want userspace to be in control of the memory map, and it
is the kernel's job to tell us whether or not this matches the HW
capabilities or not. A fixed mapping may completely clash with the
memory map I want (think emulating HW x on platform y), and there is no
reason why we should have the restrictions x86 has.
"

That's the rationale behind respining that way.

Waiting for other comments & discussions, I am going to address the iova
and dma_addr_t kbuilt reported compilation issues. Please apologize for
those.

Best Regards

Eric

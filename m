If we wanted to describe device properties via vfio, perhaps this is a
reasonable approach.  However, why would we want to do that?  How are
these device properties unique to vfio?  Are there other users that
might want to learn these properties?  How will they get them?  Perhaps
they would decide to expose them via sysfs for everyone, making this
interface redundant.  Why not start with exposing device properties to
userspace in a way that's not specific to vfio?  Thanks,

Alex

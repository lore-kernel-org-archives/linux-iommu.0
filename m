Libvirt currently does no management of mdev devices, so I believe
this example is fictitious.  The extent of libvirt's interaction with
mdev is that XML may specify an mdev UUID as the source for a hostdev
and set the permissions on the device files appropriately.  Whether
mdevs are created in advance and re-used or created and destroyed
around a VM instance (for example via qemu hooks scripts) is not a
policy that libvirt imposes.

Libvirt is also not a required component for VM lifecycles, it's an
optional management interface, but there are also VM lifecycles exactly
as you describe.  A VM may want a given type of vGPU, there might be
multiple sources of that type and any instance is fungible to any
other.  Such an mdev can be dynamically created, assigned to the VM,
and destroyed later.  Why do we need to support "empty" mdevs that do
not reserve reserve resources until opened?  The concept of available
instances is entirely lost with that approach and it creates an
environment that's difficult to support, resources may not be available
at the time the user attempts to access them.

Absolutely, vfio is a userspace driver interface, it's not tailored to
VM usage and we cannot know the intentions of the user.

I agree, this sounds like a userspace problem, mdev supports dynamic
creation and removal of mdev devices, if there's an issue with
maintaining a set of standby devices that a user has access to, this
sounds like a userspace broker problem.  It makes more sense to me to
have a model where a userspace application can make a request to a
broker and the broker can reply with "none available" rather than
having a set of devices on standby that may or may not work depending
on the system load and other users.  Thanks,

Alex

That's much preferred. And the return value wants to be documented in both
C and ASM code.

        call verify_cpu

        movq    $(init_top_pgt - __START_KERNEL_map), %rax

So if you make that:

	/*
	 * Sanitize CPU configuration and retrieve the modifier
	 * for the initial pgdir entry which will be programmed
	 * into CR3. Depends on enabled SME encryption, normally 0.
	 */
	call __startup_secondary_64

        addq    $(init_top_pgt - __START_KERNEL_map), %rax

You can hide that stuff in C-code nicely without adding any cruft to the
ASM code.

Thanks,

How about rhi_get_host_sharing_alignment()? or can you suggest a better
name I can switch to?

We have multiple rmi and rsi calls that takes ipa values. asm/rmi_cmds.h
and asm/rsi_cmds.h. Some of them takes phys_addr_t while others take
unsigned long. The spec mention these as 64 bits values. May be we
should switch them all to u64. x86 also having similar discussion=20

virt_to_phys() emits a WARN if the address is not part of the linear
map. Are you suggesting that we should add additional checks to the call
sites that pass such addresses?

Sorry, it=E2=80=99s still not clear to me how you want these calls to be
updated.

The pattern I=E2=80=99ve been following is:

Lower-level calls that use arm_smccc_1_1_invoke() take parameters as
unsigned long. I initially wanted to switch this to u64, but since
kvm/rmi.c uses unsigned long, it was decided to keep it consistent.

This approach is used in cases where the same argument is passed across
multiple calls, for example:

phys_addr_t rd_phys =3D virt_to_phys(realm->rd);
rmi_vdev_create(rd_phys, ...);
rmi_vdev_lock(rd_phys, ...);

For calls like rsi_host_call(), I chose to pass a struct pointer to
maintain better type safety:

static inline unsigned long rsi_host_call(struct rsi_host_call *rhi_call)
{
	phys_addr_t addr =3D virt_to_phys(rhi_call);

	arm_smccc_1_1_invoke(SMC_RSI_HOST_CALL, addr, &res);
}

Note that virt_to_phys() will WARN if the address is not part of the
linear map

Could you clarify what changes you would like to see in these
interfaces?

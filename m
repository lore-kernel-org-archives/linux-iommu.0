That would be great.  It still doesn't explain the barriers in the
dma sync routines.  Those have been there since the following commit
in the history tree:

commit 66b99421d118a5ddd98a72913670b0fcf0a38d45

    [PATCH] DMA: Fill gaping hole in DMA API interfaces.

    From: "David S. Miller" <davem@redhat.com>

which in fact only added them for the HP zx1 platform, and doesn't
contain any good explanation of why we need a barrier.

So I guess the right answer might be to just remove these barriers
without replacement.

It seems there is a kind of misunderstanding here. Assuming a "simple"
system with a single ITS, all devices likely to produce MSI must write
those messages in a single register, located in the ITS MSI 64kB frame
(this register is called GITS_TRANSLATER). Then the ITS discriminates
between senders using the DeviceID conveyed out-of-band on the bus (or
by other implementation defined means). For those DeviceId, a deviceId
interrupt translation table is supposed to exist, else it is going to
fault. If any "undeclared" device is writing into that register, its
deviceid will be unknown. It looks like on Intel the interrupt remapping
HW rather is abstracted on the IOMMU side; I did not take time yet to
carefully read the VT-d spec but maybe the Intel interrupt remapping HW
rather acts as an IOMMU that takes an input MSI address within the
famous window and apply a translation scheme based on the MSI address &
data? On ARM the input MSI address always is the GITS_TRANSLATER and
then the translation scheme is based on out-of-band info (deviceid) +
data content(eventid). I Hope this clarifies.

so according to the above explanation not sure it is relevant. Will/Marc
might correct me if I told some wrong things.

My understanding is a PCI device working for the host must have its own
deviceid translation table while another one assigned to a guest needs
to have another one. Each of those will then trigger different final
interrupt IDs in separate domains.

To be honest for the time being I was not addressing the ITS case but
just the simpler GICv2m case where we do not have interrupt translation.
In GICv2m with a single 4kB MSI frame you still have a single register
written by devices. The msg data content then induces a given interrupt ID.

My kernel series "just" aimed at allowing the device to reach the
physical address of the GICv2m MSI frame through the IOMMU.

But you're right here I think I should have a larger vision of what is
targeted with ITS. In GICv2m with a single MSI frame the discrimination
only works on the msi data (there is no deviceid). However it is also
possible to have several GICv2M MSI 4kB frames and in that case you can
give 1 MSI 4kB frame per VM but it is yet another use case. My AMD
system currently exposes a single MSI frame - in which case we have poor
isolation as you say -.

I don't think there is a plan for such change and I am afraid we need to
integrate above configurations (GICv2M with a single frame, GICv2M with
several frames, ITS and there may be others not covered here that I am
not aware of).

I hope this discussion will help. Please ARM guys, correct me if there
are some unclarities or wrong statements.

Thank you for reading up to here and have a nice WE!

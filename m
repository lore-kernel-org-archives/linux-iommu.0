| AFAICS this is entirely on intel-iommu - from a brief look it appears

  Adding some likely people to the Cc list so they can comment on this.
Dan Williams submitted that specific piece of code in kernel.org:3e6110fd54
... but there are lots of similar bits in that function.  Hopefully one of
the Intel I/O MMU Gurus will have a better idea of what may be going wrong
here.  In the mean time I've asked our team to gather far more detailed
debug traces showing the exact Scatter/Gather Lists we're getting, what the=
y
get translated to in the DMA Mappings, and what DMA Addresses were seeing i=
n
error.

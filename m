Marc, Robin,

Do you think this is a reasonable assumption to consider devices within
the same host iommu group share the same MSI doorbell?

Alex,

In case of nested, the vfio container is used to setup the stage2 only
whereas the stage1 is owned by the guest. Here the mapping we pass to
the host is a stage1 mapping; this information is used to build the
correct S2 mapping. Then the mapping remains the same for the whole
container. If dev1 decides to use gIOVA0 it will reach hDB0. Anyway the
granularity of the mapping cannot change.

So this rather tells this assigned dev uses this given giova for
reaching a guest MSI doorbell.

Thanks

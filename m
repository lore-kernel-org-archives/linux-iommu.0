We link against libfdt, but libfdt is for manipulating and creating
dt binary blobs. As I understand it what sysfs exposes to userspace
is not a dt binary blob (or fragment thereof) but a bit of dt source.
libfdt doesn't do parsing of source into blobs; that is done by the
dtc compiler, which QEMU doesn't currently build and which is set
up to build only a separate command line binary anyway, not to be
a utility library for compiling dt sources.

Do correct me if I'm wrong about the sysfs interface -- if it is
just exposing dt blobs that would be easier to deal with.

So we end up with even more code to pass through ACPI table
fragments as well :-(

Yeah, speaking more seriously I agree we do need to do something
here. It's just all irritatingly awkward...

OK, there's what I was missing :D

But that then seems to reveal a somewhat bigger problem - if the callers 
are simply registering IPAs, and relying on the ITS driver to grab an 
entry and fill in a PA later, then how does either one know *which* PA 
is supposed to belong to a given IPA in the case where you have multiple 
devices with different ITS targets assigned to the same guest? (and if 
it's possible to assume a guest will use per-device stage 1 mappings and 
present it with a single vITS backed by multiple pITSes, I think things 
start breaking even harder.)

Other than allowing arbitrary disjoint IOVA pages, I'm not sure this 
really works any differently from the existing MSI cookie now that I 
look more closely :/

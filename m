There is no reason for the generic page fault handler to differentiate
between stall and PRI, they are page requests. For a stall we write STAG
into grpid and set LAST_PAGE=1. Then the SMMU driver writes the page
response either as a PRI_RESP or a RESUME depending on the device type.

Let's leave out the fetch_addr field then, I was suggesting it for
completeness but I don't need it immediately, at least not for host SVA.
For dual-stage SVA (where both stage-1 and stage-2 are shared with the
CPU) we'll need the IPA field, but that's still a long way away.

As said above, generic code doesn't have to know the difference until we
start implementing nested SVA. Also, we need stall support in the fault
handler soon, since there is hardware supporting it.

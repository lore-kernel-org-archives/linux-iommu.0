I see that now - was over excited and tired last night.

OK, I understand the problem now. Early exit was the intended effect
and for some reason I thought the new version could exit too early,
but it seems fine.

I see that now.

Sure, but since this was the first non-trivial patch I submitted, I
tried to keep it non-intrusive and simple.

I'm willing to believe that if phantom functions haven't shown up and
caused problems yet, it probably doesn't need fixing in a hurry.
SR-IOV seems like a better and more common way for devices to use
multiple lightweight functions.

If no sharing, then why not just assigning the whole parent device to
the process? IMO if SVA usage is the clear goal of your series, it
might be made clearly so then Jean's series is mandatory dependency...

Not just to VM, though I/O Virtualization is in the name. You can assign
such mdev to either VMs, containers, or bare metal processes. It's just
a fully-isolated device from user space p.o.v.

yes there are something which can be shared, e.g. regarding to
the interface to IOMMU.

Conceptually I see them different mindset on device resource sharing:

WarpDrive more aims to provide a generic framework to enable SVA
usages on various accelerators, which lack of a well-abstracted user
API like OpenCL. SVA is a hardware capability - sort of exposing resources
composing ONE capability to user space through mdev framework. It is
not like a VF which naturally carries most capabilities as PF.

Intel Scalable I/O virtualization is a thorough design to partition the
device into minimal sharable copies (queue, queue pair, context), 
while each copy carries most PF capabilities (including SVA) similar to
VF. Also with IOMMU scalable mode support, the copy can be 
independently assigned to any client (process, container, VM, etc.)

Thanks

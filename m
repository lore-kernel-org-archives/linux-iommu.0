  As I noted earlier, this is an area of the kernel with which I'm not supe=
r
familiar.  Both Herbert Xu and our local VM Expert have said that having
Scatter/Gather Lists with Offsets greater than Page Size is not a bug ...

  I'm mostly trying to help out keeping focus on this because Harsh is in
India (presumable enjoying a good night's sleep while we look at this.
Hopefully we'll have a present of a bug fix for him when he wakes up ... :-=
)

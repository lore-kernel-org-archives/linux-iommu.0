At the moment I don't target SMUv2 but just SMMUv3. My focus was on
nested stage enablement without enabling the multi-CD feature (PASID),
whish is not supported by the QEMU vSMMUv3. Afterwards I realized that
basically we are pointing to a CD or PASID table and that's about the
same. I don't have a strong opinion on the name, iommu_bind_guest_table
or iommu_bind_pasid_table would be fine with me. Indeed "stage" is ARM
vocable (level for Intel?)

Yes I agree this is needed anyway.

Ah OK I missed that part of the discussion. About the sysfs API, we
devised one in the past for reserved_regions. I thought it would be
useful for QEMU to identify them but eventually Alex pushed to create a
VFIO API instead to make things more self-contained. We would need to
double check with him.

Yes actually if there is some mismatch we might get BAD_STE/BAD_CD
events. This might be another way to handle things. I did not integrate
the fault API yet. This exercise is need to understand how we can catch
things at QEMU level.

For now, I have not made any assumptions here and just made sure I was
passing the S1 Config part. I would be tempted to think that only bypass
is requested and abort/disabled could be implemented by the user by
tearing the binding down, as suggested by Jacob.

Agreed. in vSMMU I only support S1CDMax =0 so I did not get into those
troubles.

Do we agree here we can get rid of the struct device * parameter?

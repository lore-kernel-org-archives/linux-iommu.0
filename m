Hi Jacob,

Sorry, this wasn't on my radar, I only scanned for patches back through
about when Joerg refreshed his next branch (others on the list speak up
if I didn't pickup your patches for the v4.15 merge window).

This patch makes sense to me and I'm glad you were able to work through
the anomaly Harsh saw in testing as an unrelated issue, but...

What do we do about this?  I certainly can't rip out large page support
and put a stable tag on the patch.  I'm not really spotting what's
wrong with large page support here, other than the comment about it
being a mess.  Suggestions?  Thanks,

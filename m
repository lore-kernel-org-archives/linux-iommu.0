Hi,

While debugging DMA mapping error in chelsio crypto driver we observed that when scatter/gather list received by driver has some entry with page->offset > 4096 (PAGE_SIZE). It starts giving DMA error.  Without IOMMU it works fine.

Before reaching to chelsio crypto driver(driver/crypto/chelsio) following entities change the sg'

1) IN esp_output() "__skb_to_sgvec()" convert skb frags to scatter gather list. At that moment sg->offset was 4094.
2) From esp_output control reaches to "crypto_authenc_encrypt()". Here in "scatterwalk_ffwd()" sg->offset become 4110.
3) Same sg list received by chelsio crypto driver(chcr). When chcr try to do DMA mapping it starts giving DMA errors.

Following error observed. first two prints are added for debugging in chcr. Kernel version used to reproduce is 4.9.28 on x86_64.

 By applying following hack in kernel. Things start working.

1) We are not expecting issue in "scatterwalk_ffwd" because it is not the only place where kernel 
updates src->offset without checking page boundary. similar logic used in "__skb_to_sgvec".
 
2) It cannot be driver's responsibilty to update received sg entries to adjust offset and page 
because we are not the only one who directly uses received sg list.

3) Since Without IOMMU every thing works fine. We are expecting IOMMU bugs.

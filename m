Ok, that helps.

It can send plaintext packets that will be stored encrypted in memory.
(Of course the hypervisor can do that too if it has access to the guest
network).  This was my first thought on attacking SEV, but luckily NX is
designed well.

And that's great!  However, it is very different from "virtual machines
need not fully trust the hypervisor and administrator of their host
system" as said in the whitepaper.  SEV protects pretty well from
sibling VMs, but by design this generation of SEV leaks a lot of
information to an evil host---probably more than enough to mount a ROP
attack or to do evil stuff that Andy outlined.

My problem is that people will read AMD's whitepaper, not your message
on LKML, and may put more trust in SEV than (for now) they should.

Thanks,

Paolo

Another nit: this call should be after the !iovad check below

Hmm, indeed. How about we move all the heavy mapping work to
msi_domain_prepare_irqs instead? It is allowed to sleep and, more
importantly, fail. It is called much earlier, by pci_enable_msi_range.

All we are missing is details about doorbells, which we could retrieve
from the MSI controller's driver, using one or more additional callbacks
in msi_domain_ops. Currently, we already need one such callbacks for
querying the number of doorbell pages, maybe we could also ask the
driver to provide their addresses? And in msi_domain_activate, simply
search for the IOVA already associated with the MSI message?

I only briefly though about it from the host point of view, not sure how
VFIO would cope with this method.

Thanks,
Jean-Philippe

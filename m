I thought there was also /sys/firmware/fdt being the unflattened one
accessible by libfdt, but dtc -I dtb seems to be unhappy parsin this on
my Mustang.

Mark, can you refresh my memory about this?

Probaby, yes.  But I think it's even worse, because there's no guarantee
you can get at the original firmware data, because it's all from the
DSDT so invoking the initial 'probe' method of the device entry could
theoretically overwrite itself...  (If I remember the details
correctly).

At least saying ACPI guest on ACPI, and DT guest on DT host, would be a
reasonable limitation for anything like this.

But perhaps this really is a place where you need the transparency of DT
vs. ACPI to do this.

This is all outside my area of expertise, so take whatever I said above
with that disclaim.er

Agreed.

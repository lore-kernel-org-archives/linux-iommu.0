So to be 100% clear should we _ignore_ the non SVA/SVM case ?
If so then wait for necessary SVA/SVM to land and do warp drive
without non SVA/SVM path.

If you still want non SVA/SVM path what you want to do only works
if both ptr1 and ptr2 are in a range that is DMA mapped to the
device (moreover you need DMA address to match process address
which is not an easy feat).

Now even if you only want SVA/SVM, i do not see what is the point
of doing this inside VFIO. AMD GPU driver does not and there would
be no benefit for them to be there. Well a AMD VFIO mdev device
driver for QEMU guest might be useful but they have SVIO IIRC.

For SVA/SVM your usage model is:

Setup:
    - user space create a warp drive context for the process
    - user space create a device specific context for the process
    - user space create a user space command queue for the device
    - user space bind command queue

    At this point the kernel driver has bound the process address
    space to the device with a command queue and userspace

Usage:
    - user space schedule work and call appropriate flush/update
      ioctl from time to time. Might be optional depends on the
      hardware, but probably a good idea to enforce so that kernel
      can unbind the command queue to bind another process command
      queue.
    ...

Cleanup:
    - user space unbind command queue
    - user space destroy device specific context
    - user space destroy warp drive context
    All the above can be implicit when closing the device file.

So again in the above model i do not see anywhere something from
VFIO that would benefit this model.

Because you do not need any code from VFIO, nor do you need to reinvent
things. If non SVA/SVM matters to you then use dma buffer. If not then
i do not see anything in VFIO that you need.

Again this is not the long route i do not see anything in VFIO that
benefit you in the SVA/SVM case. A basic character device driver can
do that.

To me it seems you are making a policy decission in kernel space ie
wether the device should be isolated in its own group or not is a
decission that is up to the sys admin or something in userspace.
Right now existing user of SVA/SVM don't (at least AFAICT).

Do we really want to force such isolation ?

This ties back to IOMMU SVA/SVM group isolation above.

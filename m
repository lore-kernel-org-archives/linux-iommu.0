Hmm, it's probably worth thinking ahead a bit here, to the "actually 
doing things with stalls" plan. I don't have a clear picture off-hand of 
how well the new device fault handler API might fit into arm-smmu - at 
the very least trying to make it truly generic implies having to play 
nasty tricks with disable_irq() for the general case given the "IRQ may 
remain asserted while SS is active" possibility, and that isn't 
particularly inviting. Not to mention tying it into the 
pretend-auxdomain stuff that *is* rather dependent on the qcom impl. If 
it turns out that you'll eventually have to reimplement the IRQ handler 
anyway for all that, then starting off down that route *might* work out 
cleaner and less hassle overall.

Robin.

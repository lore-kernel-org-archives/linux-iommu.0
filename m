You were not looking at right place see drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem_userp=
tr.c
It does GUP and create GEM object AFAICR you can wrap that GEM object into a
dma buffer object.

Because tons of other drivers already do all of the above outside VFIO. Many
driver have a sizeable userspace side to them (anything with ioctl do) so t=
hey
can be construded as userspace driver too.

So there is no reasons to do that under VFIO. Especialy as in your example
it is not a real user space device driver, the userspace portion only knows
about writting command into command buffer AFAICT.

VFIO is for real userspace driver where interrupt, configurations, ... ie
all the driver is handled in userspace. This means that the userspace have
to be trusted as it could program the device to do DMA to anywhere (if
IOMMU is disabled at boot which is still the default configuration in the
kernel).

So i do not see any reasons to do anything you want inside VFIO. All you
want to do can be done outside as easily. Moreover it would be better if
you define clearly each scenario because from where i sit it looks like
you are opening the door wide open to userspace to DMA anywhere when IOMMU
is disabled.

When IOMMU is disabled you can _not_ expose command queue to userspace
unless your device has its own page table and all commands are relative
to that page table and the device page table is populated by kernel driver
in secure way (ie by checking that what is populated can be access).

I do not believe your example device to have such page table nor do i see
a fallback path when IOMMU is disabled that force user to do ioctl for
each commands.

Yes i understand that you target SVA/SVM but still you claim to support
non SVA/SVM. The point is that userspace can not be trusted if you want
to have random program use your device. I am pretty sure that all user
of VFIO are trusted process (like QEMU).


Finaly i am convince that the IOMMU grouping stuff related to VFIO is
useless for your usecase. I really do not see the point of that, it
does complicate things for you for no reasons AFAICT.

I am not against that but it seems to me that all you want to do is only
a matter of simplifying discovery of such devices and sharing few common
ioctl (DMA mapping, creating command queue, managing command queue, ...)
and again for all this i do not see the point of doing this under VFIO.

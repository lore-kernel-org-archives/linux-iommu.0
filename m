Linus,

I'm afraid that won't work very well - 32 bit platforms with 64-bit
addresses (LPAE) would have dma_addr_t as a 64-bit value, which
wouldn't fit into an unsigned long.

IS_ERR_VALUE() would cast a 64-bit DMA address down to a 32-bit
pointer (effectively masking with 0xffffffff).  It would have the
effect of making (eg) 0xXXXXXXXX_fffffVVV an error, where XXXXXXXX
are any of the top 32-bits of a 64-bit bus address, and VVV is the
error code value.

That could be a problem if you hit it in several places throughout
your available RAM... we'd have to mark every top page of RAM in
a naturally aligned 4GB as unusable, as well as block the top page
in natually aligned 4GB blocks from IOMMUs... and then what about
buses that have weird offsets...

So, I don't think the IS_ERR_VALUE() would work very well.

I don't know anything about that, but yeah...

The only 'problem' with this is once we do figure out a solution, the
SoC bindings will change, so both dt-bindings and dtsi needs to be
updated. But that's the case also for sm8550 and friends that currently
ignore the second SPMI bus upstream.

On FP6 again, it's definitely not a problem since everything's just on
the first SPMI bus anyways.

So then I'll revert the change to compatible =3D "qcom,milos-spmi-pmic-arb"=
, "qcom,x1e80100-spmi-pmic-arb";
plus associated subnodes for the next revision.

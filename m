In this patch series we want to wrap an already available kernel
interface to expose a device property to userspace, in order to keep
the code lighter on the userspace. We need those properties in VFIO as
VFIO grants the possibility to develop userspace drivers.

The sysfs doesn't seems to be ready for this kind of usage. We can
only find raw data that require heavy parsing. Here we retrieve
directly usable data and it can be extended later according to new
needs (as it is already done with ACPI).

This interface has been developed for VFIO and is currently bound to
it, though there is no special dependencies with it. We could make it
more generic, but I can only think of VFIO to use it.

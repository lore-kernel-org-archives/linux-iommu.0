I realize it's a bit more code and expands the changes but I thought it
would be a bit clearer as to what was going on this way. And then the
follow on patch for the physical address reduction goes in nicely, too.

If you prefer I stay with the scattered feature approach and then clear
the bit based on the MSR at the end of init_amd() I can do that. I'm
not attached to either method.

Thanks,
Tom

Yes, it would need things like that

But I think based on other discussions we are likely to tie to the KVM
to the coming IOMMUFD VIOMMU object, and the KVM will probably be
provided at object creation time to avoid this issue.

I think that is a reasonable thing, I also don't really see VMID as
being general. We will have to figure out how to ensure that the KVM
FD we got is an ARM KVM FD..

It is kind of subtle, but the only thing that will consume VMIDs is
IOMMUFD operations that are working with nested translation but not
providing KVMs. This is a pretty small blast radius - ie a specific
qemu will fail to start - that I think we can tolerate it.

More normal iommu operation will not require VMIDs so things like
driver attaching/etc is fine.

Yeah, but if someone is using such a cgroup then I expect they will
also have an up to date VMM that doesn't trigger this VMID allocation
in the first place...

The point of this mechanism is to support using this iommufd feature
without a KVM at all. We could instead prevent this directly 100% of
the time, but it means that HW with this BTM capability would not run
the legacy VMMs at all, so I'm not that keen on it..

When a KVM is present then the iommu needs to adopt the VMID of KVM,
and that should have a mechanism to ensure the VMID is valid so long
as the IOMMU is using it (eg because the KVM FD is open)

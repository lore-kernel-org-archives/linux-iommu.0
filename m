| Shoulnd't we normalize the entire sg_page(sg) + sg_offset.

  (woof) This is all above me.  I've spent a chunk of time fruitlessly
trying to find documentation which says that scatterlist's are allowed to
have offset/length values which extend outside the sg_page(sg).  So someone
much more familiar with this stuff is going to need to say what's allowed.

  As I said, I've asked Harsh to provide us with a detailed trace of exactl=
y
what he's seeing and what the Scatter/Gather Lists are getting translated
into.  That information may make it easier to understand if/how
__domain_mapping() is screwing up ...

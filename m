KVM treats host/guests very differently, so I think the distinction
between both in this context is important as this driver is for the
host only, guests are another story.

If we setup identity tables that either means there is no translation
capability for the guest(or host here) or nesting should be used,
which is discussed later in this cover letter.

We do protect the guests from the host, in the proposed approach by
preventing mapping memory from guests(or hypervisor) in the IOMMU or
donating memory currently mapped in the IOMMU.
However, at the moment pKVM doesn’t support device passthrough, so
guests don't need IOMMU page tables as they can’t use any device or issue
DMA directly.
I have some patches to support device passthrough in guests + guest
IOMMU page tables, which is not part of this series, as mentioned host
DMA isolation is critical for pKVM model, while guest device passthrough
is an optional feature (but we plan to upstream that later)

I don’t think having one domain for all devices fits most cases, SoCs can have
heterogeneous SMMUs, different addresses sizes, coherency...
Also, the basic idea of isolation between devices where some can be
controlled from userspace, or influenced by external entities, which
should be isolated. (we'd want the USB/network devices to have access to
other devices memory for example)
Another example would be accelerators, where they only operate on contiguous
memory and having such large buffers on phones in phyiscal space is almost
impossible.

I don’t think having a single domain is practical (nor it helps in this case).

The host driver follows the KVM (nvhe/hvhe) model, where at boot the
kernel (EL1) does a lot of the initialization and then it becomes untrusted
and the hypervisor manages everything after.

Similarly, The driver first probes in EL1 and does many of the complicated
stuff that is not supported at the hypervisor (EL2) as parsing firmware tables.
And ends up populating a simplified description of the SMMU topology.

Then the KVM <-> SMMU interfaces is not arch specific, you can check that
in hyp_main.c or nvhe/iommu.c where there is no reference to SMMU and all
hypercalls are abstracted so other IOMMUs can be supported under pKVM
(That’s the case in Android).

Maybe the driver at EL1 also can be further split to have a standard
part for hypercall interface and an init part which is SMMUv3 specific,
but I’d rather not complicate things until we have other users upstream..

For guest VMs (not part of this series), the interface and the kernel driver
are completely arch agnostic, similarly to virtio-iommu.

AFAICT, io-pgtable-arm has a set of assumptions about how it's called,
that’s why it’s lockless as the DMA API should follow those assumptions.
For example you can’t unmap a table and an entry inside the table concurrently,
that can lead to UAF/memory corruption, and this never happens at the moment as
the kernel has no bugs :)

However, pKVM always assumes that the kernel can be malicious, so a bad kernel
can issue such a call breaking those assumptions leading to UAF/memory corruption
inside the hypervisor. Which is not acceptable, so the solution is to use a lock
to prevent such issues from concurrent requests.

Not sure I understand this point about manipulating domains.
AFAIK, SVA is not that common, including mobile spaces but I can be wrong,
that’s why it’s not a priority here.

Yes, as mentioned later I also have a WIP implementation for KVM (which is
open source[1] :)) that I plan to send to the list (maybe in 3-4 months when
ready) as an alternative approach.

Yes, I agree, AFAIK, the current KVM pgtable code is not ready for shared
page tables with the IOMMU.

My plan was basically:
1) Finish and send nested SMMUv3 as RFC, with more insights about
   performance and complexity trade-offs of both approaches.

2) Discuss next steps for the upstream solution in an upcoming conference
   (like LPC or earlier if possible) and work on upstreaming it.

3) Work on guest device passthrough and IOMMU support.

I am open to gradually upstream this as you mentioned where as a first
step pKVM would establish DMA isolation without translation for host,
that should be enough to have functional pKVM and run protected workloads.

But although that might be usable on some systems, I don’t think that’s
practical in the long term as it limits the amount of HW that can run pKVM.

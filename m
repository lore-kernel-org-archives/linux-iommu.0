One of the issues I have with the API at the moment is that there is no
control on the page size. Imagine you have allocated a 4kB IOVA window
for your MSI, but your IOMMU can only map 64kB (not unreasonable to
imagine on arm64). What happens then?

Somehow, userspace should be told about it, one way or another.

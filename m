This one-year-old discussion is hardly exhaustive.

I think you missed the gist of the question for Eric a bit as well.

One important question for me is whether seeing the host DT is always
sufficient or if the kernel and physical device driver can have more
information about the device and its configuration which userspace may
need, which cannot be directly read in the DT (for example because the
driver has initialized the device in a specific way).  My point is, it's
really not about DT-specific things (what if you used ACPI?), but it's
about retrieving properties of a device and its configuration from
userspace.

Have we thought about the possible ways to achieve this and weight one
option against the other?

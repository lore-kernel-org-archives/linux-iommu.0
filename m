Interesting, I hadn't expected 32-bit EFI to be an option for
platforms with the SME technology. I'd assumed we could just ignore
that.

Are you saying that the encryption bit isn't supported in 32-bit
compatibility mode? We don't do a "full" switch to 32-bit protected
mode when in mixed mode, just load a 32-bit code segment descriptor.
The page tables are not modified at all.

I'm not (yet) sure that the pgd needs to be unencrypted for 32-bit EFI
when running a 64-bit kernel. In the AMD Programmer's Manual, Section
7.10.3 Operating Modes seems to indicate that running encrypted should
work fine.

I don't understand your comment about re-allocating the memmap.

The kernel builds its own EFI memory map at runtime, initially based
on the memory map provided by the firmware. We always allocate a new
memory map.

In efi_setup_page_tables() we're building our own page tables, which
should be encrypted, and mapping EFI regions described by the memmap
into those page tables.

So unless we're mapping an MMIO region (in which case _PAGE_PCD is set
in @flags for kernel_map_pages_in_pgd()) I would expect _PAGE_ENC to
be set.

That the mappings were re-used isn't a surprise.

efi_free_boot_services() lifts the reservation that was put in place
during efi_reserve_boot_services() and releases the pages to the
kernel's memory allocators.

What is surprising is that they were marked unencrypted at all.
There's nothing special about these pages as far as the __va() region
is concerned.

So it sounds like the interrupt remapping plumbing needs to be
implemented for those chips.=C2=A0=C2=A0How does ITS identify an MSI ve=
rsus any
other DMA write?=C2=A0=C2=A0Does it need to be within a preconfigured a=
ddress
space like on x86 or does it know this implicitly by the transaction
(which doesn't seem possible on PCIe)?

Along with this discussion, we should probably be revisiting whether
existing ARM SMMUs should be exposing the IOMMU_CAP_INTR_REMAP
capability.=C2=A0=C2=A0This capability is meant to indicate interrupt i=
solation,
but if an entire page of IOVA space is mapped through the IOMMU to a
range of interrupts and some of those interrupts are shared with host
devices or other VMs, then we really don't have that isolation and the
system is susceptible to one VM interfering with another or with the
host.=C2=A0=C2=A0If that's the case, the SMMU should not be claiming
IOMMU_CAP_INTR_REMAP.

I don't see that we have an option there unless ARM wants to
retroactively reserve a range of IOVA space in the spec, which is
certainly not going to happen.=C2=A0=C2=A0The only other thing that com=
es to mind
would be if there was an existing address space which could never be
backed by RAM or other DMA capable targets.=C2=A0=C2=A0But that seems f=
ar fetched
as well.

Since the current interrupt remapping schemes seem to operate in a
different address space, I expect there will be work to do to fit the
interrupt remapping within a provided address space, but it seems like =
a
very reasonable constraint to add.=C2=A0=C2=A0Thanks,

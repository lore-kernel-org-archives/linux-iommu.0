The properties that I need can be found in /proc/device-tree too. They
are of different types, with void cell value, with string cell
values(single & multiple), with integer cell value(s), array ...

The aim is to be able to assign a highly configurable platform device to
a guest, read some property values on host and write the same values in
guest dt node.

Do you advise to read the fs directly instead of using such API?

Thanks

Eric

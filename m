The AES crypto uses a tweak such that two identical plaintexts at
different locations will have different ciphertext. So swapping the
ciphertext of two pages will not result in the plaintext being swapped.

For SEV mode, relocating a physical backing page takes extra steps.
There are APIs that are used to have the AMD Secure Processor create a
transportable encrypted page that can then be moved to a new location
in memory. After moving it to the new location the APIs are used to
haves the AMD Secure Processor re-encrypt the page for use with the
guests SEV key. Based on #1 above, just moving a page without invoking
the necessary APIs will result in the decryption returning garbage.

There is nothing that prevents resuming a guest with the wrong ASID.
This relies on the resulting corruption of the guest code/data to
cause a crash.

In SEV mode, the caches are tagged with the ASID. So if you try to read
a cached page with a different ASID, it would result in a cache miss
for that ASID and will instead fetch from memory and decrypt using
the that ASID's key.

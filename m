I think I must be missing something, but...

My understanding is that ISA DMA is normally limited to 24 bits of
address - indeed, the x86 version only programs 24 bits of DMA address.
Looking through this series, it appears that the conversions mean that
the DMA mask for ISA becomes the full all-ones DMA mask, which would
of course lead to memory corruption if only 24 bits of the address end
up being programmed into the hardware.

Maybe you could say why you think this series is safe in regard to ISA
DMA?

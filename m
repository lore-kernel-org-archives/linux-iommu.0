It's more of the sequence of various includes.  For example,
init/do_mounts.c includes <linux/module.h> that eventually gets down
to <asm/pgtable_types.h> and then <asm/mem_encrypt.h>.  However, a
bit further down <linux/nfs_fs.h> is included which eventually gets
down to <linux/dma-mapping.h> and then <linux/mem_encyrpt.h>.

It's most problematic when CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT is not defined since
we never include an asm/ version from the linux/ path.  I could create
a mem_encrypt.h in include/asm-generic/ that contains the info that
is in the !CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT path of the linux/ version. Let me
look into that.

Thanks,
Tom

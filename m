Except that many existing device driver falls under that description
(ie exposing mmio, command queues, ...) and are not under VFIO.

Up to mdev VFIO was all about handling a full device to userspace AFAIK.
With the introduction of mdev a host kernel driver can "slice" its
device and share it through VFIO to userspace. Note that in that case
it might never end over any mmio, irq, ... the host driver might just
be handling over memory and would be polling from it to schedule on
the real hardware.


The question i am asking about warpdrive is wether being in VFIO is
necessary ? as i do not see the requirement myself.

Cheers,
Jérôme

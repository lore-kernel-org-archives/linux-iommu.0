Can we really know the maximum reserved iova space for a domain?  It
seems like this depends on the current composition of the domain, so it
could change as devices are added to the domain.  Or perhaps the
maximum is based on a maximally configured domain, but even then the
system itself may be expandable so it might need to account for an
architectural maximum.  A user like QEMU would likely have an easier
time dealing with an absolute maximum than a current maximum.  Maybe a
single range would be sufficient under those conditions.

For the vfio api, the interface is already specific to MSI, so that
seems reasonable.  I'd still rather expose somehow to the user that
only a single reserved MSI region is supported, even if that's all the
implementation can handle, just so we have the option to expand that in
the future.  The iommu api is internal, so we can expand it as we go, i
just want to be sure to raise the issue even if we think the
restrictions are sufficient for now.  Thanks,

Alex

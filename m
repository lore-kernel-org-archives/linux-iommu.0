In the end this is an inline function, so with a decently smart
compiler the generated code shouldn't change too much.  The big problem
that prompted me to come up with this patch is that not handling failure
from dma_map* in a swiotlb setup can lead to grave data corruption, and
we have no easy way to force error checking on these return values.

I've added a few of the static typechecking suspect if they have a
better idea on how to make the return value of dma_map_single/pages
in a way that we get warnings if dma_mapping_error isn't called on them.
But I can't really think of a good way.

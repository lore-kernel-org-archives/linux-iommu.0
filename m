Yes.

In the generic dma mapping code no struct device has always meant a
32-bit DMA mask - take a look at the dma_get_mask() function.

ISA DMA has always been rather painful in a myriad of ways, and the
DMA API so far hasn't helped, given that we don't do bounce buffering
for the 24-bit limit, but just the higher limits.  So far even if you
do use the DMA API and pass a device ISA DMA so far always meant
that the higher layers had to assure things are addressable, either
by using GFP_DMA allocation in the drivers, or mid-layer hacks like
the unchecked_isa_dma flag in SCSI and/or BLK_BOUNCE_ISA in the
block layer.

This series doesn't change those facts at all.  I have some half
started series to clean some of this up but it isn't high up on
the priority list.

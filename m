About the name change from iommu_bind_pasid_table: is the intent to
reuse this API for SMMUv2, which supports nested but not PASID? Seems
like a good idea but "iommu_bind_table" may be better since "stage" is
only used by Arm.

That part seems strange. Userspace wouldn't try arbitrary ASID sizes
until one fits, especially since ASID size isn't the only parameter:
there will be SSID, IOVA, IPA sizes, HTTU features and I guess any other
SMMU_IDRx bit that corresponds to a field in the CD or STE. Doesn't
vSMMU need to tailor its IDR registers to whatever is supported by the
host SMMU, in order to use nested translation?

Before creating the virtual ID registers, userspace will likely want to
know more about the physical IOMMU, by querying the kernel. I wrote
something about that interface recently:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/iommu/msg28039.html

And if you provide this interface, checking the parameters again in
BIND_GUEST_STAGE isn't very useful, it only tells you that userspace
read your values. Once the guest writes the CD, it could still use the
wrong ASID size or some other invalid config. That would be caught by
the SMMU walker and cause a C_BAD_CD error report.

What's the difference between aborted and disabled? I'm also not sure we
should give such fine tweaks to userspace, since the STE code is already
pretty complicated and has to deal with several state transitions.
Existing behavior (1) (2) (5) probably needs to be preserved:

(1) Initially no container is set, s1-translate s2-bypass with the
default domain (non-VFIO)
(2) A VFIO_TYPE1_NESTING_IOMMU container is set, s1-bypass s2-translate
(3) BIND_GUEST_STAGE, s1-translate s2-translate
(4) UNBIND_GUEST_STAGE, s1-bypass s2-translate
(5) Remove container, s1-translate s2-bypass with the default domain

That said, when instantiating a vSMMU, QEMU may want to switch from (2)
to an intermediate "s1-abort s2-translate" state. At the moment with
virtio-iommu I only create the stage-2 mappings at (3). This ensures
that transactions abort until the guest configures the vIOMMU and it
keeps the host driver simple, but it has the downside of pinning guest
memory lazily (necessary with virtio-iommu since the guest falls back to
the map/unmap interface, which doesn't pin all memory upfront, if it
can't support nested).

Other required fields in the BIND_GUEST_STAGE ioctl are at least s1dss,
s1cdmax and s1fmt. It's not for sanity-check, they describe the guest
configuration. The guest selects a PASID table format (1-level, 2-level
4k/64k) which is written into STE.s1fmt. It also selects the behavior of
requests-without-pasid, which is written into STE.s1dss. s1cdmax
corresponds to pasid_bits.

Thanks,
Jean

This is not a bug.  The network stack can and will feed us such
SG lists.

No the driver must deal with this.  Having said that, if we can
improve our driver helper interface to make this easier then we
should do that too.  What we certainly shouldn't do is to take a
whack-a-mole approach like this patch does.

Dear all,

I am currently investigating the usage of sysfs to retrieve info from
the host device tree to build guest dt node for assigned devices (just
to explain a bit of context for Peter & Alex added in cc). For more
complex devices we could typically copy host settings on guest side (mac
@, various speeds, functional modes, ...).

This follows the "Re: [RFC PATCH v3 0/3] vfio: platform: return device
properties for a platform device" thread.

I have some questions:

- the device directory can be somewhere in /sys/devices/platform, ie.
can be in sub-directories. The first difficulty is to locate it. Do you
know any C routing doing find-file matching a file name pattern? Didn't
find any in qemu, nor in glib.

- I currently prototype this functionality using popen + find. That
works but relies on "find" executable availability. Is it a valid
assumption?

- I would need to build various utility functions such as
read_u32_array_prop(char *path, const char *prop_name,
                               uint32_t *props, uint32 num)
path being the of_node directory path, prop_name being the name of the
property to get the value; this for each type of property I need to
fetch and assign to the guest ... Is it the right direction?

Putting things on kernel - VOSYS approach - and exposing new VFIO IOTCL
enable to use std kernel APIs and remove the problem of finding data on
the fs ...

Please advise on the direction to follow, continue exploring the sysfs
method or revert to VOSYS approach?

Thank you in advance

Best Regards

Eric

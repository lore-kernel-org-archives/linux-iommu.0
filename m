We may be able to do that.

The encryption bit is supported in 32-bit compatibility mode and since
we're not doing the "full" switch the cr3 register will remain as a
64-bit register so we can leave the pgd table encrypted.

Sorry, I mis-interpreted the efi_map_regions function/loop and see
that the memmap is always allocated by the kernel.

Right, let me keep looking into this to see if I can pin down what
was (or is) happening.

Right. But then you need to express it differently in a consistent way. Not by
hacking around it by setting desc->irq to 0.

Something like a flag field in msi_desc which denotes various properties would
be a possible solution. MSI_IRQ_ALLOCATED and MSI_IRQ_REMAPPED would be
sufficient for now. And the deallocation/cleanup would rely on those flags
rather than checking desc->irq.

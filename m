I think the key is that for each SG segment, sg->page doesn't
necessarily represent "a" page, but the first of one or more contiguous
pages. Disregarding offsets for the moment, Here's a typical example of
a 120KB buffer from the block layer as processed by iommu_dma_map_sg():

[   16.092649] == initial (4) ==
[   16.095591]  0: virt ffff800001372000	phys 0x0000000081372000	dma 0x0000000000000000

[   16.137440] 		offset 0x00000000	length 0x00001000	dma_len 0x00000000
[   16.216167] == final   (2) ==
[   16.219106]  0: virt ffff800001372000	phys 0x0000000081372000	dma 0x00000000ffb60000

[   16.233056] 		offset 0x00000000	length 0x0000d000	dma_len 0x00010000

i.e. segments of 14 pages, 13 pages, 2 pages and 1 page respectively
(and we further merge the resulting DMA-contiguous segments on top of
that).

Now, there are indeed plenty of drivers and subsystems which do work on
lists of explicitly single pages - anything doing some variant of
"addr = kmap_atomic(sg_page(sg)) + sg->offset;" is easy to spot - but I
don't think DMA API implementations are in a position to make any kind
of assumption; nearly all of them just shut up and handle sg->length
bytes from sg_phys(sg) without questioning the caller, and I reckon
that's exactly what they should be doing.

Logically, it should mean the same thing as whatever a length of more
than 1 page means to Xen - judging by blkif_queue_rw_req() at least,
that seems to be a BUG_ON() in both cases.

As I've said before, I'd certainly consider it a denormalised case, but
not a bogus one, and certainly not something that is the DMA API's job
to police. Having now audited every dma_map_ops::map_sg implementation I
could find, the only ones not using sg_phys()/sg_virt() or some other
construction immune to the absolute offset value (MIPS even explicitly
normalises it) are intel-iommu and arch/frv, and the latter is clearly
broken anyway as it ignores sg->length.

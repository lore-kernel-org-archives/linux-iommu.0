Is the fact that it uses only 6 vectors documented in the public spec?

Is this a chipset erratum?  Are there newer versions of the chipset
that fix this, e.g., by requesting 8 vectors and using 6, or by also
supporting MSI-X?

I know this conserves vector numbers.  What does that mean in real
user-visible terms?  Are there systems that won't boot because of this
issue, and this patch fixes them?  Does it enable bigger
configurations, e.g., more I/O devices, than before?

Do you know how Windows handles this?  Does it have a similar interface?

As you can tell, I'm a little skeptical about this.  It's a fairly big
change, it affects the arch interface, it seems to be targeted for
only a single chipset (though it's widely used), and we already
support a standard solution (MSI-X, reducing the number of vectors
requested, or even operating with 1 vector).

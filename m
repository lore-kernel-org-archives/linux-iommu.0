Yeah, there's already 17 pointers in dma_map_ops of which about half are 
optional, so these awkward #ifdefs to save one more probably aren't 
worth the inconsistency they bring. It feels like this guy mostly goes 
hand-in-hand with dma_supported, so ack to giving it the same look and feel.

That's reasonable, although in many cases we should know the effective 
IOMMU input address size which would be even neater.

AFAICS it might boil down to simply:

	mask = roundup_pow_of_two(phys_to_dma(dev, PFN_PHYS(max_pfn))) - 1;

Sounds good; in the meantime I'll happily drop these two.

Robin.

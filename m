Hi All,

Ironically, since the correction of the IOMMU_CAP_CACHE_COHERENCY bug
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/29/514) in vfio_iommu_type1.c, my Calxeda
Midway VFIO use case is not working anymore. This is also observable
when I do not apply at all the whole [PATCH v5 0/4] vfio: type1: support
for ARM SMMUS with VFIO_IOMMU_TYPE1 series.

My understanding is this series should not be requested for me since my
xgmac device does not care about the XN attribute.

My understanding is that without the bug or the series, the IOMMU_CACHE
flag is set whereas before it was not. Patching vfio_iommu_type1.c
vfio_iommu_type1_attach_group and unsetting IOMMU_CAP_CACHE_COHERENCY
makes the use case functional again.

I do not understand the exact semantic of IOMMU_CAP_CACHE_COHERENCY. I
see the arm smmu always returns true, and if my understanding is correct
the vfio_iommu_type1 sets the IOMMU_CACHE attribute which eventually
make the ARM SMMU sets the memory attribute to cacheable in the PTE. But
naively I would say the interco used in Midway may not be cache coherent
capability (ARM ACE, ACE-lite), hence the issue.

Please could you share your knowledge/understanding about this topic.
Adding Will in to ;-)

Thank you in advance

Best Regards

Eric

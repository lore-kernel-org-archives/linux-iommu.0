We're not talking about just one more page.  We're talking about
_every_ page that _may_ map to a bus address in the range of 4GB - 4K
(a point I've already made earlier in this discussion.)

It's not just about physical addresses, it's about bus addresses,
and there are buses out there that have a translation between physical
address and bus address without IOMMUs and the like.

Can we know ahead of time about all these translations?  It means
moving that information out of various bus drivers into core
architecture code (yuck, when you have multiple different platforms)
or into DT (which means effectively breaking every damn platform
that's using older DT files) - something that we don't have to do
today.

I remain 100% opposed to your idea.

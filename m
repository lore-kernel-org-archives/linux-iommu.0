After checking ioreg -l under macOS on the MacBook Neo (which is the one 
Apple Silicon MacBook having the non-force-touch trackpad variant, and 
sending no stm report), I'm convinced it legit has no Serial to report 
for the keyboard/trackpad HID devices, so we'll always have to use the 
fake one there.

Knowing this, I'd rule out Option 2). Between option 1 (timeout) and 
option 3 (device tree node), I prefer the device tree node. We already 
have the keyboard subnode and we know for each MacBook model whether it 
has an stm or not, so having the stm subnode seems logical. As a bonus, 
the code for this is quite simple, and I will prepare the v2 of this 
series shortly.

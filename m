No worries, thanks for all the feedback.

So maybe something along the lines of an enum that would have entries
(initially) like KERNEL_DATA (equal to zero) and EFI_DATA. Others could
be added later as needed.

Would you then want to allow the protection attributes to be updated
by architecture specific code through something like a __weak function?
In the x86 case I can add this function as a non-SME specific function
that would initially just have the SME-related mask modification in it.

Thanks,
Tom

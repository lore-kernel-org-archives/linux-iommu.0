Why is the existing driver model not good enough ? So you want
a device with function X you look into /dev/X (for instance
for GPU you look in /dev/dri)

Each of those device need a userspace driver and thus this
user space driver can easily knows where to look. I do not
expect that every application will reimplement those drivers
but instead use some kind of library that provide a high
level API for each of those devices.

I see the enumeration as an orthogonal problem. There have
been talks within various circles about it because new system
bus (CAPI, CCIX, ...) imply that things like NUMA topology
you have in sysfs is not up to the task.

Now you have a hierarchy of memory for the CPU (HBM, local
node main memory aka you DDR dimm, persistent memory) each
with different properties (bandwidth, latency, ...). But
also for devices memory. Some device can have many types
of memory too. For instance a GPU might have HBM, GDDR,
persistant and multiple types of memory. Those device are
on a given CPU node but can also have inter-connect of their
own (AMD infinity, NVlink, ...).


You have HMAT which i was hopping would provide a new sysfs
that supersede old numa but it seems it is going back to
NUMA node for compatibilities reasons i guess (ccing Ross).


Anyway i think finding devices and finding relation between
devices and memory is 2 separate problems and as such should
be handled separatly.

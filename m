I looked into this and this would be a large change also to parse tables
and build lists.  It occurred to me that this could all be taken care of
if the early_memremap calls were changed to early_ioremap calls. Looking
in the git log I see that they were originally early_ioremap calls but
were changed to early_memremap calls with this commit:

commit abc93f8eb6e4 ("efi: Use early_mem*() instead of early_io*()")

Looking at the early_memremap code and the early_ioremap code they both
call __early_ioremap so I don't see how this change makes any
difference (especially since FIXMAP_PAGE_NORMAL and FIXMAP_PAGE_IO are
identical in this case).

Is it safe to change these back to early_ioremap calls (at least on
x86)?

Thanks,
Tom

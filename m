Okay, so the BIOS defines one RMRR entry:

	DMAR: RMRR base: 0x000000cdb11000 end: 0x000000cdb30fff

But the device-scope doesn't seem to match any existing devices in your
system. At least no device gets the RMRR mappings later on.

That doesn't really matter, as the the fault-address of 0xcdacd000 is
outside of the defined RMRR range anyway.

Looking at the fault-address as system physical, is would be in this
range of system memory:

	BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000cd99b000-0x00000000ce3a0fff] reserved

Which is reserved for BIOS use. This looks very much like a missing RMRR
entry for that range, that has the sata controler in its device scope.

Don't forget that a container represents the IOMMU context in a vfio
environment, groups are associated with containers and a group may
contain one or more devices.  When a vIOMMU comes into play, we still
only have an IOMMU context per container.  If we have multiple devices
in a group, we run into problems with vIOMMU.  We can resolve this by
requiring that the user ignore all but one device in the group,
or making sure that the devices in the group have the same IOMMU
context.  The latter we could do in QEMU if PCIe-to-PCI bridges there
masked the per-device address space as it does on real hardware (ie.
there is no requester ID on conventional PCI, all transactions appear to
the IOMMU with the bridge requester ID).  So I raise this question
because vfio's minimum domain granularity is a group.

Except all devices within all groups within the same container
necessarily share the same IOMMU context, so from that perspective, it
appears to impose non-trivial redundancy on the caller.  Thanks,

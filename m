I rebooted my host in ACPI mode and I am not able to find the attribute
files anymore in sysfs. the of_node directory where the files were
located does not exist anymore (/sys/firmware/devicetree/base) and I
wonder whether we can get access to those same info somewhere in sysfs
(/sys/firmware). Obviously they are in the ACPI tables but ... Alex do
you know how it works on x86?

So I wonder whether the userspace has a unified way to fetch data in
sysfs whatever the type of HW description (DT, ACPI) or at least if it
not a unified way whether he have a simple way to achieve that on userspace.

As opposed to that the kernel offers that feature through the unified
device properties API, the one used in this series.

Hang on! The existing quirk only worked for vfio groups last time I
checked and didn't actually solve the problem for using the device on
the host.

Alex had done a bunch of work to support requester id quirks (see
http://marc.info/?l=linux-pci&m=137357663626523&w=3), but that seems
blocked.

No, I can prove that both .0 and .1 are used on the 9172 controller,
depending on which of the two SATA port(s) is(are) in use. If you have
the same hardware, I suggest you verify this.

The Ricoh firewire function simply uses the wrong requester ID. The
other functions work correctly. Remapping only the firewire specific
function of the multifunction device (as in my patch) fixes the
problem.

a.

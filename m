This breaks on platforms where sizeof(phys_addr_t) > sizeof(unsigned
long). I.e. it's not always safe to assume that PAGE_MASK is the
correct width.

IIUC it looks like this has been broken ever since commit e1605495c716
"intel-iommu: Introduce domain_sg_mapping() to speed up
intel_map_sg()". I.e. it looks like the calculation for pte_val should
be:

    pteval = (page_to_phys(sg_page(sg)) + sg->offset) | prot;

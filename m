m68k has no iommu, and not operations that operate on a scatterlist.

mips has a trivial iommu driver (jazzdma), but I wrote the current
instance of it, nad it is fine.

powerpc has various iommu, but actually enables ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN
unconditionally.

It basically means someone is iterating using manual pointer arithmetics
over a multi-element scatterlist instead of using the sg_next and
for_each_sg helpers.

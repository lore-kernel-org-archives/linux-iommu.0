right, this was difference in the behavior now.

I understand your concern on standardizing the error codes from xlate,
add_device, others and handling them properly. As you said there are quite some
errors returned from them today. Also another thing is standardizing the
behavior of of_iommu_configure itself. So that API serves to connect a device
to its correct iommu_ops. When that's not possible, what should be the output
and how should that be handled by the caller. The current behavior is to
either 1) connect to correct ops or 2) wait for it or 3) progress further
with plain/default dma_ops. Anyways as you said standardizing the iommu api
ops, would make the of_iommu_configure handling more specific. Having said that
i think similar fix needs to be done for acpi's iort_iommu_configure as
well.

When you say "merge this patch (or something similar)", is that about
documenting the error values for of_xlate and add_device that you showed
down below  (or) about the patch in discussion ?

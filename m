The caller is in ARM specific code(SMMUv3 driver). But at present, the kvm =
pointer
is passed to it by IOMMUFD during nested domain allocation time. And IOMMUF=
D
gets the kvm pointer from VFIO during device bind operation.

Not sure,, how this flow is going to be in  the new IOMMUFD VIOMMU object m=
odel
Jason referred. If not through IOMMUFD, SMMUv3 has to have a way to figure =
out
the KVM associated with the device. =20

See patch 3, kvm_arch_pinned_vmid_get() return -EINVAL if VMID =3D=3D 0. Fo=
r ARM64/KVM
VMID 0 is always reserved and never allocated for a Guest.

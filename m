Indeed.  And that shows how the original code was making a mess of these
different constants..

I'll see if I can split this out somehow, but I'm not sure it is going
to be all that much more readable..

Yes, that is what I'm more worried about.

The nice bit of standardizing the value is that we get rid of an
indirect call, which generally is much more of a problem at the
micro-architecture level.

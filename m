I have been thinking about this, and I think most of the initialization
won’t be changed, and we would do any possible initialization in the
kernel avoiding complexity in the hypervisor (parsing
device-tree/acpi...) also that makes code re-use easier if both drivers
do that in the kernel space.

KVM IOMMU subsystem is very different from the one kernel, it’s about
paravirtualtion and abstraction, I tried my best to make sure all
possible code can be re-used by splitting arm-smmu-v3-common.c and
io-pgtable-arm-common.c and even re-using iommu_iotlb_gather from the
iommu code.
So my guess, there won't be much of that effort as there is no
duplication in logic.

I am still thinking about how v3 will look like, but as mentioned I am
inclined to Jason’s suggestion to reduce the series and remove the
paravirtualtion stuff and only establish DMA isolation as a starting point.
That will remove a lot of code from the KVM IOMMU for now, but we'd
need to address that later.
And we can build on top of this code either a para-virtual approach or
nested-emulation one.

For the IOMMU KVM code, it’s quite different from the kernel one and serves
different purposes, so there is no logic duplication there.
The idea to use hypercalls/function calls in some places for VHE/nVHE,
doesn’t really translate here, as already the driver is abstracted by
iommu_ops, unlike KVM which has one code base for everything, as I
mentioned in another reply, we can standardize the hypercall part of the
kernel driver into a an IOMMU agnostic file (as virtio-iommu) and the
KVM SMMUv3 kernel driver would ony be responsible for initialization,
that should be the closest to the split model in nVHE.

Also, pKVM have some different code path in the kernel, for example pKVM
has a different mem abort handler, different initialization (pkvm.c)

Hi Alex,

I tried to sketch a proposal for guaranteeing the IRQ integrity when
doing ARM PCI/MSI passthrough with ARM GICv2M msi-controller. This is
based on extended VFIO group viability control, as detailed below.

As opposed to ARM GICv3 ITS, this MSI controller does *not* support IRQ
remapping. It can expose 1 or more 4kB MSI frame. Each frame contains a
single register where the msi data is written.

I would be grateful to you if you could tell me whether it makes any sense.

Thanks in advance

Best Regards

Eric


1) GICv2m with a single 4kB single frame
   all devices having this msi-controller as msi-parent share this
   single MSI frame. Those devices can work on behalf of the host
   or work on behalf of 1 or more guests (KVM assigned devices). We
   must make sure either the host only or 1 single VM can access to the
   single frame to guarantee interrupt integrity: a device assigned
   to 1 VM should not be able to trigger MSI targeted to the host
   or another VM.

   I would propose to extend the VFIO notion of group viability.
   Currently a VFIO group is viable if:
   all devices belonging to the same group are bound to a VFIO driver
   or unbound.

   Let's imagine we extend the viability check as follows:

   0) keep the current viable check: all the devices belonging to
      the group must be vfio bound or unbound.
   1) retrieve the MSI parent of the device and list all the
      other devices using that MSI controller as MSI-parent (does not
      look straightforward):
   2) they must be VFIO driver bound or unbound as well (meaning
      they are not used by the host). If not, reject device attachment
   - in case they are VFIO bound (a VFIO group is set):
     x if all VFIO containers are the same as the one of the device's
       we try to attach, that's OK. This means the other devices
       use different IOMMU mappings, eventually will target the
       MSI frame but they all work for the same user space client/VM.
     x 1 or more devices has a different container than the device
       under attachment:
       It works on behalf of a different user space client/VM,
       we can't attach the new device. I think there is a case however
       where severals containers can be opened by a single QEMU.

Of course the dynamic aspects, ie a new device showing up or an unbind
event bring significant complexity.

2) GICv2M with multiple 4kB frames
   Each msi-frame is enumerated as msi-controller. The device tree
   statically defines which device is attached to each msi frame.
   In case devices are assigned we cannot change this attachment
   anyway since there might be physical contraints behind.
   So devices likely to be assigned to guests should be linked to a
   different MSI frame than devices that are not.

   I think extended viability concept can be used as well.

   This model still is not ideal: in case we have a SR-IOV device
   plugged onto an host bridge attached to a single MSI parent you won't
   be able anyway to have 1 Virtual Function working for host and 1 VF
   working for a guest. Only Interrupt translation (ITS) will bring that
   feature.

3) GICv3 ITS
   This one supports interrupt translation service ~ Intel
   IRQ remapping.
   This means a single frame can be used by all devices. A deviceID is
   used exclusively by the host or a guest. I assume the ITS driver
   allocates/populates deviceid interrupt translation table featuring
   separate LPI spaces ie by construction different ITT cannot feature
   same LPIs. So no need to do the extended viability test.

   The MSI controller should have a property telling whether
   it supports interrupt translation. This kind of property currently
   exists on IOMMU side for INTEL remapping.

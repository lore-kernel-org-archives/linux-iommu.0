When doorbell is ring the hardware start fetching commands from
the queue and execute them ? If so than a rogue process B might
ring the doorbell of process A which would starts execution of
random commands (ie whatever random memory value there is left
inside the command buffer memory, could be old commands i guess).

If this is not how this doorbell works then, yes it can only do
a denial of service i guess. Issue i have with doorbell is that
i have seen 10 differents implementations in 10 differents hw
and each are different as to what ringing or value written to the
doorbell does. It is painfull to track what is what for each hw.

No it is not, network device, GPU, block device, ... they all do
support DMA. The point i am trying to make here is that even in
your mechanisms the userspace must have a specific userspace
drivers for each hardware and thus there are virtually no
differences between having this userspace driver open a device
file in vfio or somewhere else in the device filesystem. This is
just a different path.

So this is why i do not see any benefit to having all drivers with
SVM (can we please use SVM and not SVA as SVM is what have been use
in more places so far).

Perhaps the iounmap() check should be kept for now for safety, since
some drivers (vga16fb for example) call iounmap() blindly even if the
mapping wasn't returned from ioremap().  Maybe add a warning when an
ISA address is passed to iounmap().

Yes there could be some surprises in drivers use the normal ioremap()
call which is uncached but were expecting the default write-through
mapping.

Changing VGA_MAP_MEM() to use ioremap_wt() would take care of that.
Although, looking at the mdacon/vgacon, they don't have support for
unmapping the frame buffer if they are built modular.

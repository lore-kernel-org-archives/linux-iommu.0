About the granularity, I think ARM GICv3 now provides a similar
capability with GICv3 ITS (interrupt translation service). Along with
the MSI MSG write transaction, the device outputs a DeviceID conveyed on
the bus. This DeviceID (~ your source-ID) enables to index a device
table. The entry in the device table points to a DeviceId interrupt
translation table indexed by the EventID found in the msi msg. So the
entry in the interrupt translation table eventually gives you the
eventual interrupt ID targeted by the MSI MSG.
This translation capability if not available in GICv2M though, ie. the
one I am currently using.

Those tables currently are built by the ITS irqchip (irq-gic-v3-its.c)

Do you confirm that VFIO user API still still is the good choice to
provide that IOVA range?

I have no objection to move that iova allocation scheme somewhere else.
I just need to figure out how to deal with the fact iova.c is not
compiled everywhere as I noticed too late ;-)

I agree with you on the fact it would be cleaner to manage that natively
at MSI controller level instead of patching the address value in
vfio_pci_intrs.c. I will investigate in that direction but I need some
more time to understand the links between the MSI controller, the PCI
device and the IOMMU.

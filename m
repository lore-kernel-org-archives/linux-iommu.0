You can add my:
 Tested-by: Jesper Dangaard Brouer <brouer@redhat.com>
or
 Acked-by: Jesper Dangaard Brouer <brouer@redhat.com>

I'm very happy that you work on this.  And I've done micro-benchmark
testing of the patchset (and branch dma-direct-calls), which I've made
avail here:
 https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-project/blob/master/areas/dma/dma01_test_hellwig_direct_dma.org

My XDP performance is back, minus the BPF-indirect call, and
net_rx_action napi->poll, and net_device->ndo_xdp_xmit calls.  I
verified that manually disabling retpoline for these remaining netstack
retpoline-calls restore the performance full (well minus 1.5 nanosec).

Good news Eric !

Here are more information about the NOEXEC flag. This flag is used to
set the XN flag on the PTE, which make the page non-executable (XN is
set if NOEXEC is set).

As it used to be an EXEC flag (XN was set by default, unset if EXEC
was set), this patch serie was mandatory for PL330 test, since it
executes some code from memory. Now that it has been reversed to
NOEXEC (XN is not set by default), every page is executable, so it
works but there may be a security issue.

I think it is better to have it if it is working, but for
simplification we can add it later (as the requirement dropped when
the flag has been reversed).

Best regards,
Baptiste

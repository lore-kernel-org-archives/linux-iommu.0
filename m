Here's another case:

i.MX6 with 4GB of RAM.  Devices are mapped to 0-0x0fffffff physical,
RAM is mapped to 0x10000000-0xffffffff physical.  The last 256MB of
RAM is not accessible as this is a 32-bit device.  DMA addresses are
the same as physical addresses.

While the final physical page will be highmem in a normal kernel,
and thus will not be available for kmalloc(), that doesn't mean it
can't happen.  A crashdump kernel loaded high in physical memory
(eg, last 512MB and given the last 512MB to play around in) would
have the top 512MB as lowmem, and therefore available for kmalloc().

If a page is available in lowmem, it's available for kmalloc(), and
we can't say that we will never allocate memory from such a page for
DMA - if we do and we're using an IS_ERR_VALUE() scheme, it _will_
break if that happens as memory will end up being mapped by the DMA
API but dma_mapping_error() will see it as a failure.

It won't be an obvious breakage, because it depends on the right
conditions happening - a kmalloc() from the top page of physical
RAM and that being passed to dma_map_single().  IOW, it's not something
that a quick boot test would find, it's something that is likely to
cause failures after a system has been running for a period of time.

There are other situations where there are possibilities - such as:

	dma_map_page(dev, page, offset, size, direction)

If 'page' is a highmem page which happens to be the top page in the
4GB space, and offset is non-zero, and there's a 1:1 mapping between
physical address and DMA address, the returned value will be
0xfffff000 + offset - within the "last 4095 values are errors"
range.

Networking uses this for fragments - the packet fragment list is
a list of pages, offsets and sizes - we have sendpage() that may
end up finding that last page, and TCP-sized packets may be
generated from it which would certianly result in non-zero offsets
being passed to dma_map_page().

So, whatever way _I_ look at it, I find your proposal to be unsafe
and potentially regression causing, and I *completely* and strongly
oppose it in its current form.

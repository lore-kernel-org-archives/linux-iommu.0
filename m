Previously to support efi runtime in kexec, I passed some efi
infomation via setup_data, see below userspace kexec-tools commit:
e1ffc9e9a0769e1f54185003102e9bec428b84e8, it was what Boris mentioned
about the setup_data use case for kexec.

Suppose you have successfully tested kexec reboot, so the EFI tables you
mentioned should be those area in old mem for copying /proc/vmcore? If
only EFI tables and swiotlb maybe not worth to passing those stuff
across kexec reboot.

I have more idea about this for now..

Thanks a lot!

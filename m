Yes, so this sounds better than the cyclic thing you explained
where you have to add and update since early_memremap() calls into
memremap_should_map_encrypted() which touches the list we're updating at
the same time.

So in the case where you absolutely know that those ranges should
be mapped decrypted, we should have special helpers which do that
explicitly and they are called when we access those special regions.
Well, special for SME. I'm thinking that should simplify the handling
but you'll know better once you write it. :)

Thanks.

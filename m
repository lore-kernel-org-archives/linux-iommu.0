I suspect that most other OS will also solve this class of problem using
a standard such as DT or ACPI, because they also provide dependency for
clock, interrupts, power management, etc. We can add a self-contained
PROBE method if someone makes a case for it, but it's unlikely to get
used at all, and nearly impossible to implement in Linux. The host would
still need a method to tell the guest which device to probe first, for
example with kernel parameters.

In drivers/base/dd.c, really_probe() calls dma_configure() before the
device driver's probe(). dma_configure() ends up calling either
of_dma_configure() or acpi_dma_configure(), which return -EPROBE_DEFER
if the device's IOMMU isn't yet available. In that case the device is
added to the deferred pending list.

After another device is successfully bound to a driver, all devices on
the pending list are retried (driver_deferred_probe_trigger()), and if
the dependency has been resolved, then dma_configure() succeeds.

Another method (used by Intel and AMD IOMMU drivers) is to initialize
the IOMMU as early as possible, after discovering it in the ACPI tables
and before probing other devices. This can't work for virtio-iommu
because the driver might be a module, in which case early init isn't
possible. We have to defer probe of all dependent devices until the
virtio and virtio-iommu modules are loaded.

Thanks,
Jean

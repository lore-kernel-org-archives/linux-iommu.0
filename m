I don't think so, because you still need a driver for the physical IOMMU
in the hypervisor. virtio-iommu would only replace the hypercall interface
with queues, and I don't think that buys us anything.

Maybe virtio on the guest side could be advantageous, because that
interface has to be stable and virtio comes with stable APIs for several
classes of devices. But implementing virtio in pkvm means a lot of extra
code so it needs to be considered carefully.

To minimize the attack surface of the hypervisor, we don't want to load
any superfluous code, so the hypervisor part of the SMMUv3 driver only
contains code to populate tables and send commands (which is still too
much for my taste but seems unavoidable to isolate host DMA). Left in the
host are things like ACPI/DT parser, interrupts, possibly the event queue
(which informs of DMA errors), extra features and complex optimizations.
The host also has to implement IOMMU ops to liaise between the DMA API and
the hypervisor.

Cool! The hypervisor part contains iommu/iommu.c which deals with
hypercalls and domains and doesn't contain anything specific to Arm (it's
only in arch/arm64 because that's where pkvm currently sits). It does rely
on io-pgtable at the moment which is not used by VT-d but that can be
abstracted as well. It's possible however that on Intel an entirely
different set of hypercalls will be needed, if a simpler solution such as
sharing page tables fits better because VT-d implementations are more
homogeneous.

Thanks,
Jean

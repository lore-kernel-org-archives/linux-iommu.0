This series calls the dma ops configuration for the devices
at a generic place so that it works for all busses.
The dma_configure_ops for a device is now called during
the device_attach callback just before the probe of the
bus/driver is called. Similarly dma_deconfigure is called during
device/driver_detach path.

       |                         |

       |                         |

__device_attach_driver    __device_attach_driver
       |
driver_probe_device
       |
really_probe
       |
dma_configure

Similarly on the device/driver_unregister path __device_release_driver is
called which inturn calls dma_deconfigure.

Rebased the series against mainline 4.11-rc1. Applies and builds cleanly
against mainline and linux-next. There is a conflict with patch#9
against iommu-next, but that should go away eventually as iommu-next
is rebased against 4.11-rc1.
  
* Tested with platform and pci devices for probe deferral
  and reprobe on arm64 based platform.

Previous post of this series [6]. 

 [V9]
     * Rebased on top of 4.11-rc1.

     * Merged Robin's fixes for legacy binding issue,
       pci devices with no iommu-map property.
     
 [V8]
     * Picked up all the acks and tested tags from Marek and
       Hanjun for DT and ACPI patches respectively, since
       no functional changes was done.

     * Addressed Minor comments Sinan and Bjorn.

     * Added Robin's fix for fixing the deferencing NULL for
       of_iommu_table after init in patch #2.

     * Rebased it on top of linux-next

 [V7]
     * Updated the subject and commit log for patch #6 as per
       comments from Lorenzo. No functional changes.

 [V6]
     * Fixed a bug in dma_configure function pointed out by
       Robin.
     * Reordered the patches as per comments from Robin and
       Lorenzo.
     * Added Tags.

 [V5]
     * Reworked the pci configuration code hanging outside and
       pushed it to dma_configure as in PATCH#5,6,7.
       Also added a couple of patches that Lorenzo provided for
       correcting the Probe deferring mechanism in case of
       ACPI devices from here [5].

 [V4]
     * Took the reworked patches [2] from Robin's branch and
       rebased on top of Lorenzo's ACPI IORT ARM support series [3].

     * Added the patches for moving the dma ops configuration of
       acpi based devices to probe time as well.
 [V3]
     * Removed the patch to split dma_masks/dma_ops configuration
       separately based on review comments that both masks and ops are
       required only during the device probe time.

     * Reworked the series based on Generic DT bindings series.

     * Added call to iommu's remove_device in the cleanup path for arm and
       arm64.

     * Removed the notifier trick in arm64 to handle early device
       registration.

     * Added reset of dma_ops in cleanup path for arm based on comments.

     * Fixed the pci_iommu_configure path and tested with PCI device as
       well.
 
     * Fixed a bug to return the correct iommu_ops from patch 7 [4] in
       last post.

     * Fixed few other cosmetic comments.
  
 [V2]
     * Updated the Initial post to call dma_configure/deconfigure from
       generic code
 
     * Added iommu add_device callback from of_iommu_configure path

 [V1]
     * Initial post from Laurent Pinchart [1]

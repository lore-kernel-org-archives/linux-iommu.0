I'm less knowledgeable about ACPI but I think you're right. Would you like to 
tackle this for v4.13 ? :-)

I meant the patch we're discussing, "[PATCH V2 2/3] iommu: of: Ignore all 
errors except EPROBE_DEFER". Sorry for the confusion. One more comment about 
this below.

I would turn this into a dev_dbg(), as at least the -ENODEV error returned 
from add_device has a defined meaning (see the comment in add_iommu_group()) 
and is in my opinion not a condition that should be reported in the kernel log 
by default.

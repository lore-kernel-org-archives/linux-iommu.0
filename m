The whitepaper explains the technologies and the value they provide.
It's up to you to decide if you'd want to use it.

It does protect well against cold boot attacks. It might offer some
protection against Rowhammer since if a bit got flipped the entire
16B chunk would be decrypted differently.

The whitepaper talks about this a little, but it has a minimal impact
on system performance when accessing an encrypted page.

DMA should function normally unless the device does not support the
addressing requirements when SME is active. When the encryption mask is
applied (bit 47 of the physical address in this case), if the device
doesn't support 48 bit or higher DMA then swiotlb bounce buffers will
be used.

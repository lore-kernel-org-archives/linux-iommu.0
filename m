As far as the BIOS is concerned I can only switch between:
- disabled,
- AHCI mode,
- IDE mode.

The problem occurs in both IDE and AHCI modes.

Apart from that I am also able to bring up RAID setup window for this =20
controller, right after turning the computer on, but since there are no=
 =20
disks connected to it there's nothing I can alter.

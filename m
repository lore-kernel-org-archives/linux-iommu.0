I dismissed emulating the SMMU early on because it feels too complex
compared to an abstracted hypercall interface, but again that may be due
to the high variation of configurations of the SMMU. For nesting, you
could use some of the interface that Yi Liu and Jacob Pan have been
working on [1]. It should be possible with a couple of attach-table and
tlb-invalidate hypercalls to avoid emulating the low-level registers and
queues.

It doesn't use nested translation because it is optional in the SMMU, and
this series tries to support any possible implementation. Since pKVM on
arm64 is being used on mobile platforms I suspect that, to save space,
some SMMUs might not implement first-level or second-level page tables.
Besides, supporting nesting for Arm would still require hypercalls for
pinning DMA pages (solution 2).

This series populates the second-level tables with the complete IOVA -> PA
translation (similarly to how VFIO works at the moment). If an
implementation only supports first-level tables, then the hypervisor would
own it and put the IOVA -> PA translation in there.

Thanks,
Jean

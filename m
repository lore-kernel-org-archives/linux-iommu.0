Below mentioned log was already there in 1st mail. Copied here for easy reference. Let me know if you need
additional traces.

1) IN esp_output() "__skb_to_sgvec()" convert skb frags to scatter gather list. 
At that moment sg->offset was 4094.
2) From esp_output control reaches to "crypto_authenc_encrypt()". Here in 
"scatterwalk_ffwd()" sg->offset become 4110.
3) Same sg list received by chelsio crypto driver(chcr). When chcr try to do 
DMA mapping it starts giving DMA errors.

Following error observed. first two prints are added for debugging in chcr. 
Kernel version used to reproduce is 4.9.28 on x86_64 with Page size 4K.

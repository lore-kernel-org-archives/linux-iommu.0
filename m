Yes that's the objective to put this intelligence in the QEMU VFIO
device or more precisely in the associated function that builds its
guest dt node.

Let's take an example. Assuming an xgmac supports different speeds, you
need to set those on guest. Either you put arbitrary values or you reuse
the values that were set on host. Typically some values may not be
supported by the HW.

Idea of genericity was ruled out indeed meaning each device needs to
have a specialized QEMU VFIO device and an associated dt node creation
function. Now this does not prevent from exploiting host dt information.
Does that make sense?

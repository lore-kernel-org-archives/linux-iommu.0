VFIO is a userspace driver framework, the VM use case just happens to
be a rather prolific one.  VFIO was never intended to be solely a VM
device interface and has several other userspace users, notably DPDK
and SPDK, an NVMe backend in QEMU, a userspace NVMe driver, a ruby
wrapper, and perhaps others that I'm not aware of.  Whether vfio is
appropriate interface here might certainly still be a debatable topic,
but I would strongly disagree with your last sentence above.  Thanks,

Yup; I just wanted something that would easily backport to stable, at least as
far as linux-4.9.y (where I couldn't find the minimum GCC version when I looked
yesterday).

I was trying the old kernel.org crosstool binaries, but I was either missing a
library (or I have an incompatible version) on my x86_64 host. I'll have

We use the unified device property interface.

For device assignment, we need to transfer those properties to the
guest in order to fully exploit the device (and not simply transfer
generic properties for a given device).

The example I have in mind is the PL330 which can have optionnal
properties, as described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/arm-pl330.txt

This has been bound to VFIO as we needed it for VFIO, but I don't see
any reasons not to expose it somewhere else if it may be reused.

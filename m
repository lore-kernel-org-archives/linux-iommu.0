I had the same idea at the beginning. But finally I found that the life cycle
of the virtual device for VM and process were different. Consider you create
some mdevs for VM use, you will give all those mdevs to lib-virt, which
distribute those mdev to VMs or containers. If the VM or container exits, the
mdev is returned to the lib-virt and used for next allocation. It is the
administrator who controlled every mdev's allocation.

But for process, it is different. There is no lib-virt in control. The
administrator's intension is to grant some type of application to access the
hardware. The application can get a handle of the hardware, send request and get
the result. That's all. He/She dose not care which mdev is allocated to that
application. If it crashes, it should be the kernel's responsibility to withdraw
the resource, the system administrator does not want to do it by hand.
